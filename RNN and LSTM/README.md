# RNN Applications in Natural Language Processing

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating the practical applications of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The notebook specifically focuses on implementing various RNN architectures for sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie reviews dataset.

## Contents

- In-depth explanation of RNN architectures and their applications in NLP
- Step-by-step implementation of different RNN variants
- Comparative analysis of model performance
- Visualization of results and model architectures
- Discussion of practical challenges and solutions
- Comparison with modern NLP approaches

## RNN Architectures Implemented

1. **Simple/Vanilla RNN**: Basic recurrent structure
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Advanced architecture that addresses the vanishing gradient problem
3. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: Simplified version of LSTM with comparable performance
4. **Bidirectional RNNs**: Process sequences in both forward and backward directions
5. **RNNs with Attention**: Enhanced models that focus on relevant parts of input sequences

## Dataset

The notebook uses the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. This dataset is publicly available and comes pre-loaded with TensorFlow/Keras.

The notebook requires the following libraries:
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
